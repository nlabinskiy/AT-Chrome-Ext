Chrome gives you a quick way of loading up your working directory for testing. Let's do that now.

- Visit chrome://extensions in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox: The menu's icon is three horizontal bars.. and select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).

- Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.

- Click Load unpacked extensionâ€¦ to pop up a file-selection dialog.

- Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live, and select it.
